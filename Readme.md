## SHR- Sexual Harassment Recollection Dataset


Dataset for our work - '#YouToo? Detection of Personal Recollections of Sexual Harassment on Social Media' accepted as a long paper at ACL 2019.

We're currently in the process of anonymizing our dataset, and ensuring the dataset is compliant with the ethical considerations we discuss in our work. The dataset will be made available, once we've ensured no author identifying information is still present in our dataset.
